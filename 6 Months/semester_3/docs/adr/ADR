# Architecture Decision Record: ScoutConnect Platform

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Decision Makers:** Project Team  
**Reviewers:** Technical Lead, Product Owner  

## Context

ScoutConnect is a backend system designed to help coaches and scouts discover and evaluate under-the-radar athletes. The platform needs to centralize player data, provide intelligent evaluation tools, and foster collaboration between sports professionals while maintaining high performance, security, and scalability.

## Problem Statement

Currently, many talented athletes go unnoticed due to:
- Lack of exposure and standardized evaluation platforms
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria across organizations
- Limited collaboration tools for sports professionals
- Difficulty in tracking and comparing athlete performance data

## Decision Summary

We have decided to build ScoutConnect as a **backend-first platform** using modern web technologies with a focus on data integrity, security, and collaborative features.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Backend Framework
**Decision:** FastAPI or Django  
**Rationale:**
- FastAPI: High performance, automatic API documentation, modern Python async support
- Django: Mature ecosystem, built-in admin interface, excellent ORM
- Both provide strong security features and testing capabilities

**Alternatives Considered:** Flask, Node.js/Express
**Risk Mitigation:** Final framework choice will be made during Week 1 based on specific performance requirements

### 2. Database Architecture
**Decision:** PostgreSQL as primary database  
**Rationale:**
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Strong support for complex queries and relationships
- JSON field support for flexible sport-specific data
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Mature backup and replication features

**Alternatives Considered:** MongoDB, MySQL
**Trade-offs:** More complex setup than SQLite, but necessary for production scalability

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
**Decision:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)  
**Rationale:**
- Stateless authentication suitable for API-first architecture
- Easy integration with frontend applications
- Granular permission control for different user types (coaches, scouts, administrators)
- Industry standard with good library support

**Security Considerations:**
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure token storage recommendations
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 4. Containerization Strategy
**Decision:** Docker with Docker Compose for development and deployment  
**Rationale:**
- Consistent development environment across team members
- Simplified deployment process
- Easy database and service management
- Scalability preparation for future microservices migration

**Services Architecture:**
- Web application container
- PostgreSQL database container
- Redis container (future caching layer)
- Development tools container (pgAdmin)

### 5. Data Model Design
**Decision:** Multi-sport flexible schema with sport-specific extensions  
**Rationale:**
- Core entities: Users, Players, Evaluations, Sports, Teams
- Sport-specific criteria stored as JSON fields for flexibility
- Standardized scoring metrics with customizable weightings
- Historical data preservation for trend analysis

**Key Entities:**
```
Users (coaches, scouts, admins)
├── Players (athlete profiles)
├── Evaluations (performance assessments)
├── Sports (sport-specific configurations)
├── Teams (organizational groupings)
├── Watchlists (curated player collections)
└── Comments (collaboration features)
```

### 6. API Design Philosophy
**Decision:** RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation  
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard for web APIs
- Self-documenting with automatic schema generation
- Easy testing and integration
- Clear versioning strategy

**API Structure:**
- `/api/v1/auth/` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/players/` - Player management
- `/api/v1/evaluations/` - Performance evaluations
- `/api/v1/sports/` - Sport configurations
- `/api/v1/collaboration/` - Watchlists, comments, sharing

### 7. Scoring and Analytics Engine
**Decision:** Modular scoring system with pluggable criteria  
**Rationale:**
- Universal metrics applicable across sports
- Sport-specific criteria as configurable modules
- Growth tracking and clutch performance analysis
- Recruitability scoring with transparency

**Components:**
- Base scoring algorithms
- Sport-specific metric calculators
- Trend analysis engine
- Hidden talent identification logic

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Week 1-2:** Foundation setup (environment, database, authentication)
2. **Week 3-5:** Core functionality (player profiles, evaluations, scoring)
3. **Week 6-8:** Advanced features (comparison tools, collaboration)
4. **Week 9-11:** Data integration and testing
5. **Week 12:** Documentation and deployment preparation

### Code Quality Standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Code coverage minimum: 85%
- Linting and formatting with industry tools
- Git workflow with pull request reviews
- Automated CI/CD pipeline

### Security Requirements
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Regular security dependency updates

### Performance Considerations
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- API response time targets: <200ms for simple queries
- Pagination for large result sets
- Asynchronous processing for heavy computations

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complex Scoring Algorithms**
   - Iterative development approach
   - Early testing with sample data
   - Modular design for independent testing

2. **Data Model Evolution**
   - Database migration strategy
   - Version control for schema changes
   - Backward compatibility considerations

3. **Time Constraints**
   - Strict milestone adherence
   - Weekly progress reviews
   - Scope adjustment protocols

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All planned API endpoints operational
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Complete API documentation

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Reliable data storage and retrieval
   - Accurate scoring calculations
   - Consistent evaluation results

3. **Performance Standards**
   - API response times under targets
   - Database query efficiency
   - System stability under load

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- External sports data API integrations
- Machine learning predictive models
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Mobile application support

### Scalability Preparation
- Microservices migration path
- Caching layer implementation
- CDN integration for media content
- Auto-scaling infrastructure

### Security Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication
- Advanced audit logging
- Penetration testing schedule
- Compliance certification preparation
