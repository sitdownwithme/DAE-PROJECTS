# ðŸŽ¯ DAE PROJECTS

Welcome to the official repository for **DAE PROJECTS**, a creative and technical initiative under the **Sit Down With Me** brand. Here, we build projects that blend culture, code, communityâ€”and a little bit of hustle from both the South and the North.

## ðŸ§  About

**DAE PROJECTS** stands for _Design. Apply. Execute._  
We're creating tools, digital experiences, and prototypes that bridge storytelling, performance, and tech.

From sneaker customizers to SIEM simulators, this repo hosts our work-in-progress and finished builds that reflect:

- A love for innovation and design
- Rooted experience in city culture (ATL to CT)
- Projects that teach, showcase, or support technical growth

## ðŸ’» What's Inside?

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `TA_Lacrosse_Customizer/` | A seasonal, support-based lacrosse shoe design app built in Python |
| `SIEM_Simulator/`         | A lightweight cybersecurity simulation using ELK on Parrot OS |
| `Flowcharts_Algorithms/`  | Visuals and step-by-step logic to explain our code thinking |
| `PodcastAssets/`          | Files and drafts connected to the **Sit Down With Me** podcast project |

Each folder contains its own purpose, whether it's a coding demo, community experiment, or narrative tech piece.
