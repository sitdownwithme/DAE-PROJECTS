# Jordan Fields - Professional Profile

## Who I Am

Hello! I'm Jordan Fields — a lifelong learner and aspiring SOC Analyst currently studying at DAE. My journey is guided by faith, purpose, and a strong commitment to growth. I’m motivated by the importance of building a lasting legacy and staying grounded in what truly matters, while chasing my dreams and allowing God to direct my steps.  

When I'm not coding or working on projects, I’m enjoying life’s moments — whether staying active, outdoors, or simply embracing time that reminds me why I push forward. I believe growth isn’t just about advancing in technology, but about becoming wiser and stronger along the way.  

## My Values

- **Faith & Purpose:** I trust God’s plan and lean on resilience to keep moving forward.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Always exploring, always improving, never settling.  
- **Collaboration:** I want to work with people who care more about impact than status, who are excited to build together.  
- **Balance:** True success includes peace of mind and meaningful connections.  
- **Excellence:** Whatever I commit to, I give it my all — with focus, discipline, and integrity.  

## Career Aspirations

### Ideal Work Environment

I'm seeking a collaborative and innovative work environment that values continuous learning and professional growth. I thrive in organizations that encourage creativity, provide mentorship opportunities, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

I'm particularly interested in roles in **Cybersecurity (SOC Analysis, Incident Response, Digital Forensics)** where I can apply my skills in log analysis, detection, and problem-solving, while continuing to grow.  

### Professional Philosophy

I believe in sustainable progress over burnout culture. My goal is to build meaningful and secure solutions while maintaining balance, growth, and a positive mindset.

### Team Dynamics
