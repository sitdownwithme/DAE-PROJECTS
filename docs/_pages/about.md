# Jordan Fields - Professional Profile

## Who I Am

Hello! I'm Jordan Fields, a passionate developer and problem-solver currently studying at DAE. 

Despite experiencing trauma, I never imagined I would find myself in a web development class truly enjoying it. Life is about recognizing opportunities and embracing the bridges that come our way - crossing them with confidence. Welcome to my perspective; feel free to explore and enjoy the journey.

When I'm not coding, you can find me building endless memories with my family. You might catch me at the nearest beach, track, or SkyZone. I believe self-care is invaluable, while living expenses are just part of the journey.

## My Values

- **Continuous Learning:** I believe in harmony and coexistence, fostering growth through understanding.
- **Collaboration:** I thrive in team environments where diverse perspectives lead to innovative solutions.
- **Quality:** I'm committed to excellence in every mission. We all have goals - it's business, not personal.
- **Problem-Solving:** Strategic thinking is underrated, yet it has been transformative in my life.

## Career Aspirations

### Ideal Work Environment

I'm seeking a collaborative and innovative work environment that values continuous learning and professional growth. I thrive in organizations that encourage creativity, provide mentorship opportunities, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

### Preferred Roles

I'm particularly interested in roles in **Web Development** and **DevOps**, where I can leverage my skills in understanding and enhancing human experiences through technology.

### Professional Philosophy

I prioritize sustainable development practices over toxic hustle culture. My goal is to build innovative solutions without sacrificing personal well-being or work-life balance.

### Team Dynamics

I excel in teams that value open communication, mutual respect, and diverse perspectives. I flourish in environments where team members support each other's growth and collaborate effectively to achieve shared objectives.
