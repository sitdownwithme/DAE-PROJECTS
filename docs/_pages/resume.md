## Cybersecurity Projects

### Law Enforcement SOC Lab: Municipal Infrastructure Protection
*September 2025 - December 2025 (In Progress)*

**Project Overview:** Building a comprehensive Security Operations Center environment simulating protection of municipal law enforcement systems, focusing on critical infrastructure monitoring and digital evidence chain-of-custody management.

**Core Infrastructure:**
* Deployed 4-VM simulated municipal network (911 CAD System, Evidence Management Database, Surveillance Network Controller, Officer Workstation)
* Configured ELK Stack SIEM with legal compliance logging and evidence audit trails
* Implemented file integrity monitoring with Wazuh for evidence tampering detection

**Detection & Monitoring:**
* Developing 8-10 custom SIEM detection rules for law enforcement scenarios (unauthorized database queries, evidence tampering, credential compromise, data exfiltration)
* Creating 5-7 specialized dashboards for critical system monitoring and chain-of-custody audit trails
* Building automated alerting for insider threats and privilege escalation attempts

**Incident Response & Documentation:**
* Designing 6-8 LE-specific incident response playbooks (ransomware on 911 systems, compromised credentials, surveillance breaches, insider threats)
* Executing 8 attack simulations including brute force, phishing, ransomware, and data exfiltration scenarios
* Documenting 10-12 investigations with court-admissible chain-of-custody procedures and evidence hash verification

**Automation & Compliance:**
* Developing Python scripts for automated chain-of-custody report generation with timestamps and digital fingerprints
* Implementing real-time file integrity monitoring with automated alerting to SIEM
* Creating legal admissibility checklists and evidence handling procedures

**Key Technologies:** ELK Stack, Wazuh, Suricata, Python, PowerShell, Kali Linux, PostgreSQL, Windows Server, Syslog-ng, Metasploit, Nmap, Hydra

**Portfolio Deliverables:** GitHub repository with SIEM configurations and detection rules, 10-12 documented case investigations, incident response playbook library, demo video showcasing live attack detection and response

---

### Incident Response Playbook & Lab Environment
*June 2025*

**Project & Role:** Designed and implemented an Incident Response Lab to simulate ransomware attack on high-value confidential data, serving as both lab architect and incident response playbook developer.

**Security Operations:**
* Built isolated network environment with pfSense firewall, Windows Server, and Linux systems
* Deployed ELK Stack SIEM with Wazuh for real-time threat detection and log correlation
* Configured Sysmon for advanced Windows endpoint monitoring and forensic data collection

**Incident Response Development:**
* Created comprehensive IR playbook following NIST 800-61 framework (Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Incident)
* Executed controlled ransomware simulation using custom binary and Metasploit framework
* Performed tabletop and live attack exercises to validate detection and response procedures

**Detection & Analysis:**
* Achieved Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) < 15 minutes through optimized SIEM alerting
* Conducted forensic analysis of attack artifacts and created detailed incident timelines
* Documented evidence collection procedures maintaining chain-of-custody standards

**Key Results:**
* Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) < 24 hours with 100% data recovery validation
* Aligned response procedures with ISO/IEC 27035 standards
* Delivered end-to-end playbook with network diagrams, recovery validation reports, and training documentation

**Technologies:** ELK Stack, Wazuh, Sysmon, pfSense, Metasploit, DVWA, Kali Linux, Windows Server, Linux (Apache, Postfix)
