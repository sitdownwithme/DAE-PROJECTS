  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    Iâ€™m <strong>Jordan Fields</strong>, a cybersecurity student and aspiring SOC Analyst focused on law enforcement applications of digital security. 
    My journey began in backend development, but Iâ€™ve transitioned into cybersecurity to practice real-world defensive monitoring, 
    incident response, and digital forensics.

  <h2>What Youâ€™ll Find Here</h2>
  <p>
    This site highlights my projects and design work. Each section demonstrates how Iâ€™ve built hands-on labs that connect classroom learning 
    with real SOC analyst workflows. Youâ€™ll see projects that cover <strong>incident response, SOC environments, law enforcement system protection, 
    and secure web development</strong>.

  <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incident Response Playbook</strong> â€” A lab simulating ransomware response using NIST 800-61, pfSense, ELK, Wazuh, and Metasploit.</li>
    <li><strong>Sports Connect</strong> â€” A web app connecting athletes and coaches, focusing on secure user authentication and database controls.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Enforcement SOC Project</strong> â€” A combined project that began as a Mini SOC training lab (log collection, SIEM dashboards, detection engineering, and case reporting) 
    and expanded into a <strong>law enforcement-focused SOC environment</strong>. It simulates municipal infrastructure protection, integrates forensic playbooks, and 
    applies court-admissible chain-of-custody documentation to mirror real-world investigative needs.</li>
