# Welcome to My Portfolio  

Hi, I’m **Jordan Fields** 👋🏾 — a lifelong learner and aspiring **SOC Analyst** currently studying at DAE. Guided by faith and purpose, I’m building hands-on skills in **cybersecurity, incident response, and security operations**.  

On this site, you’ll find:  
- **About Me** → My background, values, and career aspirations.  
- **Projects** → Hands-on cybersecurity labs and simulations I’ve built, including my **Incident Response Playbook**, **Sports Connect**, and my **Law Enforcement SOC (Mini SOC Capstone)**.  
- **Updates** → Reflections, progress, and lessons I’m learning along the way.  

I want this portfolio to feel welcoming — a place where you can see my work, my growth, and my commitment to becoming an excellent SOC analyst.
